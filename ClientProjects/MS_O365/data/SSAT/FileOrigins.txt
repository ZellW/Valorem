Subject: RE: SSAT Drop - New Priority

Ticket data has now been uploaded to your share. You should see a 276 MB file titled 
TicketListJuly01_Jan27.xlsx. Had difficulty saving as CSV so left as an Excel workbook. 
Please note I’ve also included the SSAT survey data as an additional tab. You can use either 
the original survey data file I sent you earlier in the week or the data on SSAT tab. 
They’re almost identical except the newer source has a few more days worth of survey data. 
Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks,

I found the problem! The access verification code was (for some reason) being sent to one of my 
sub-folders due to a rule I had in place. So, the initial link was being sent to my Junk Mail, 
and the verification code was being routed to a seemingly random subfolder! Ugh. Oh well. ??

In any event, I’ve successfully uploaded the tenant list (550 MB). Please verify that you’ve 
received and are having no problems accessing. 

I’ll work on sending over the ticket list next (should be uploaded within an hour). 

Thanks,
